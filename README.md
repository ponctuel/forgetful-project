When it's your first time using the browser, run `install.bat` and wait for the installation to complete

After that, you can just open `run.bat` and everything will work perfectly.

### Why this browser ?

This browser blocks cookies / trackers

<! -- THE BROWSER DOESN'T SUPPORT EXTENSIONS AND POP-UPS AT THE TIME I AM WRITING THIS -->

Can be used to bypass AliExpress first time discount and multiple things so you can buy for really cheap everytime / doing your own things
